# JRT-Trackmaps

Trackmap data for Joel Real Timing (JRT) Overlays v0.1.0

## But, why!?

JRT Overlays creates the trackmaps automatically when the first 1 or 2 laps have been driven. The trackmap is based upon the driving line. So turns are not recorded as they are, but as they are driven. That's especially visible in chicanes. In addition to that, if you happen to have a crash, the trackmap can look weird.

This repository provides trackmaps, which represent the track better than the driving line. To achieve this, I drive around the track rather slowly in the middle of the track.

## How to use it?

You can either download the files using the "Clone or download"-button and selecting "Download ZIP" or clone the repository somewhere using Git, so you can easily pull updates.

The contents of the repository are the contents of the folder `.\Documents\Joel Real Timing\trackmaps`. If you don't know what to do with the files, please have a look at the website of JRT-Overlays at [joel-real-timing.com](https://joel-real-timing.com/trackmap_en.html). If that doesn't help, please be patient I'm going to add instructions here as well.

## What's contained?

* Coords for the trackmap.
* Rotation of the 2d trackmap. I try to use common representations here.
* Camera angle of the 3d trackmap.
* Turn names.

## Track missing?

I only just started doing this and the process is a bit tedious, so it will take some time. At least there are already two variants of the Nordschleife (Industriefahrten and Kurzanbindung w/o Arena).

I'm going to prepare a way, that you can contribute as well, to speed up the completion of trackmaps for all tracks.
